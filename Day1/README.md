Day 1 :
**Recursion:** 
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly 
to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. In a recursive function,
the function is defined in terms of itself. Each recursive call works on a smaller portion of 
the problem until a base case is reached, which is a condition that stops the recursion.

**Memoization:** It ensures that a method doesn't excute for the same inputs more than once by keeping 
a record of the results for the given inputs (usually in a hash map,Hashtable,and Array).
